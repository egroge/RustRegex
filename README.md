# RustRegex
A regex comiler written in Rust

This is my first Rust project, and as such is simply an exercise in learning. It is also an exercise to learn a little about compilers. As such it does not use an FSM structure, but tokenises a regex string, then parses into an AST.

I have tried to write lots of tests, taking advantage of Rust's build in test framework.
